# UvA Deep Learning 1 Course - Practicals

This is a repository containing the code part of the three assignments of the Deep Learning 1 course for the AI MSc at University of Amsterdam. A significant part of the code was generated by the TAs of the course, and is hosted [here](https://github.com/uvadlc/uvadlc_practicals_2021).

## Environment

The TAs provided two conda environments that install all main packages that needed for the practicals. If additional packages were needed for specific assignments, I have added them to the environment files.

The environment `dl2021_cpu.yml` installs all packages for a CPU-only system, while the `dl2021_gpu.yml` installs the versions of packages that support GPUs as well.
